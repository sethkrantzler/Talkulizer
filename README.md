# Seth Loves to Talk Audio Visualizer

Hello! My name is Seth, I love to talk. I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHADUjRasSXYua_KZryZgVw) channel where I make videos, and a [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/sethlovestotalk) stream where I livestream a radioshow with my friend Mark. I wanted to make a visualizer I could customize to give something visually interesting for people to look at while I'm talking, and help give the vibe that you're listening to the radio. Follow the below instructions to setup the visualizer for yourself, you can add your own presets by running the json-server, customize visualizations by moving the sliders around. If you don't know where to start, try using some of the presets and modifying from there.

HOW TO USE

1. run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. run `npm start` in a command prompt
3. run `npm run server`


TO DO

- customizable number of lines, etc.
- Label things
- hookup more params across different things
- Icon and Title
