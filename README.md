[Try The Seth Loves to Talk Customizable Audio Visualizer aka "The Talkulizer" HERE!-> https://sethkrantzler.github.io/Talkulizer/](https://sethkrantzler.github.io/Talkulizer/)

Hello! My name is Seth, I love to talk. I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHADUjRasSXYua_KZryZgVw) channel where I make videos, and a [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/sethlovestotalk) stream where I livestream a radioshow with my friend Mark. I wanted to make a visualizer I could customize to give something visually interesting for people to look at while I'm talking, and help give the vibe that you're listening to the radio. Follow the below instructions to setup the visualizer for yourself, you can add your own presets by running the json-server, customize visualizations by moving the sliders around. If you don't know where to start, try using some of the presets and modifying from there.

HOW TO USE

1. run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. run `npm start` in a command prompt
3. run `npm run server` to start the local server that manages the presets. You can use the presetsDb.json to manage your own preset library!
